## Question 1

**What is the full date and time of the email delivery?**

To answer this, begin by opening the `.eml` file in **Thunderbird**. While Thunderbird shows the date/time in the GUI, we need to confirm the raw header value.

Instead, open the email in **Sublime Text**:

```bash
subl challenge1.eml
Scroll down to the Date: header to find the precise timestamp.
